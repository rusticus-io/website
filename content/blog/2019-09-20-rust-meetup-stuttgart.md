summary: Introducing the Rust Meetup Stuttgart (Germany)
---

This is the website of the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming language
meetup Stuttgart, Germany.

We are a lose group of Rust-Enthusiasts working (as hobbyists) in different
spaces of Rust, fiddling around with Rust on microcontrollers, the CLI and in
Game Engines, Web and all other domains.

We meet about once a month in the [Hackspace Stuttgart](https://shackspace.de).
We do have a [matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#rust-stuttgart:matrix.org)
a
[gettogether page](https://gettogether.community/rust-stuttgart/),
and a
[github organization](https://github.com/rust-stuttgart) (not to be
confused with the
[organization for this site](https://github.com/rusticus-io/)).

You never heard about Rust but want to learn about it? You're welcome to join
us! You're one of the top Rust contributors? You're welcome as well!
We welcome beginners as well as advanced users!
